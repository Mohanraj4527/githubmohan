        <h2><u>INCENSE STICK</u></h2>

           <img src="Images\incense stick.jpg" width="350" height="200">

           <p>Incense is an aromatic biotic material that releases fragrant smoke when burnt. The term is used for either the material or the aroma.Incense is used for aesthetic reasons, religious worship, aromatherapy, meditation, and ceremonial reasons. It may also be used as a simple deodorant or insect repellent.

            Incense is composed of aromatic plant materials, often combined with essential oils. The forms taken by incense differ with the underlying culture, and have changed with advances in technology and increasing number of uses.
            
            Incense can generally be separated into two main types: "indirect-burning" and "direct-burning." Indirect-burning incense or "non-combustible incense" is not capable of burning on its own, and requires a separate heat source. Direct-burning incense or "combustible incense" is lit directly by a flame and then fanned or blown out, leaving a glowing ember that smoulders and releases a smoky fragrance. Direct-burning incense is either a paste formed around a bamboo stick, or a paste that is extruded into a stick or cone shape.</p><br>

            The word camphor means Karpur in Sanskrit and Kapur in Hindi. It has been widely in use for several years in Indian households. We can categorize them into edible and synthetic camphor. We obtain edible camphor, which has numerous medicinal properties, from the bark and wood of camphor laurel.
            
            We can use camphor for various purposes. We light camphor, during Hawans and Aartis, to make Gods and Goddesses happy. When we burn camphor during our prayers for Lord Shiva, we can accompany our prayers with the chanting of this mantra:</p><br>

In comparison, detergent powders are made using a synthetic surfactant. Along with the surfactant, detergent powders have many other ingredients and chemicals that improve the efficiency of the surfactant. A surfactant, also known as a surface-active agent, is a substance whose spreading and diluting properties increase, when added to water or a liquid, making it the ideal detergent.

            <img src="Images\napkin.jpg" width="350" height="200">

            <p>A menstrual pad is an absorbent item worn in the underwear when menstruating, bleeding after giving birth, recovering from gynecologic surgery, experiencing a miscarriage or abortion, or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina. A menstrual pad is a type of menstrual hygiene product that is worn externally, unlike tampons and menstrual cups, which are worn inside the vagina. Pads are generally changed by being stripped off the pants and panties, taking out the old pad, sticking the new one on the inside of the panties and pulling them back on. Pads are recommended to be changed every hours to avoid certain bacteria that can fester in blood; this time also may differ depending on the kind worn, flow, and the time it is worn.[1]

                Menstrual pads are made from a range of materials, differing depending on style, country of origin, and brand.The pads are not the same as incontinence pads, which generally have higher absorbency and are worn by those who have urinary incontinence problems. Although menstrual pads are not made for this use, some use them for this purpose.</p><br>
